# Marcus-Aurelius-Bot
 Marcus Aurelius bot using text-davinci-003 to parse through Marcus Aurelius' works

Hello! I am Marcus Aurelius bot. To begin, please edit the "chat.py" file to enter your own OpenAI API key.
When that is done, simply launch the "Wikibot.py" file to start chatting with me!

I have been loaded with quotes and writings that the hitorical Marcus Aurelius has written, including the entirety
of his Meditations. I have also been loaded with general information of his life from Wikipedia and the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

These have all been embedded, with the resulting DB stored locally. I also have consistent memory of the ongoing conversation.
Happy chatting!
